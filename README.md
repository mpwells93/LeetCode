1) Two Sum:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Level- Easy

Acceptance- 40.1% of submissions

Problem-
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example-

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

------------------------------------

2) Add Two Numbers:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

Level- Medium

Acceptance- 30.4% of submissions

Problem- 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

3) Integer to Roman:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/

Level- Medium

Acceptance- 49.4% of submissions

Problem- 
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: 3
Output: "III"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "IV"
Example 3:

Input: 9
Output: "IX"
Example 4:

Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

4) Valid Number:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/

Level- Hard

Acceptance- 13.7% of submissions

Problem- 
Validate if a given string can be interpreted as a decimal number.

Some examples:
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true
" -90e3   " => true
" 1e" => false
"e3" => false
" 6e-1" => true
" 99e2.5 " => false
"53.5e93" => true
" --6 " => false
"-+3" => false
"95a54e53" => false

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one. However, here is a list of characters that can be in a valid decimal number:

Numbers 0-9
Exponent - "e"
Positive/negative sign - "+"/"-"
Decimal point - "."
Of course, the context of these characters also matters in the input.

------------------------------------

5) Integer to English Words:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/

Level- Hard

Acceptance- 23.7% of submissions

Problem- 
Convert a non-negative integer to its english words representation. Given input is guaranteed to be less than 2^31 - 1.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: "One Hundred Twenty Three"
Example 2:

Input: 12345
Output: "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
Example 3:

Input: 1234567
Output: "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
Example 4:

Input: 1234567891
Output: "One Billion Two Hundred Thirty Four Million Five Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety One"

------------------------------------

6) Friend Circles:

Direct Link- https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/

Level- Medium

Acceptance- 52.2% of submissions

Problem- 
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
Example 2:
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
Note:
N is in range [1,200].
M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.
